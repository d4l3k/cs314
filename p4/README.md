HOW TO PLAY:
The object of this game is to hold off the blob invaders for as long as possible from reach your cube. 
Your cube has 10 lives and you start with $10,000 in which you can build two types of defenses: walls and turrets (No one knows how you have ammunition for the turrets or bricks for that matter). 
Walls can withstand multiple hits from blobs and are your best defense against the rolling menace. Turrets are you only source of offense but are destroyed instantly by any damage. To create either, click on a location square to build either. Defenses may be refunded for partial cost and walls may be repaired. Walls may be stacked upon each other and turrets maybe be placed on top of walls.
The game’s camera is controlled by mouse movements as well as the arrow keys on a keyboard. 
Enemies arrive in waves which are initiated by the player – before each wave, the player is given time to fortify their defenses. 

INSPIRATION:
This game was inspired by the many flash-based defend-your-castle as well as the tower defense games that are on the internet. Gameplay elements such as defending a central point and utilizing towers and walls to slow and destroy invaders were borrowed from these games.
